12:19 PM | We3 Vision: for my company website and now i am not able to use that domain

12:19 PM | Richie from Hostinger: Done, I would like to note that I already register this domain for you, and now you can set that up from your home page ‚úîÔ∏è 
 
 Previously it is not activated due to the INFO keyword, which is suspicious. It's active now and waiting for your verification from the mail:

 Do keep in mind that it might take up to 24 hours for DNS changes to fully propagate worldwide. So DNS propagation is the time it takes updates to DNS records to be in full effect across all servers on the internet. But don't worry, it usually propagates much faster than that! üó∫Ô∏è 
 
 Let me know how it goes and if you have any more questions, I'll be here for you!

12:19 PM | We3 Vision: and i have to present my company to some events. and for that i required the hosting

12:20 PM | Richie from Hostinger: I see, thank you for the details. Domain is active now, you may use it as I have manually approve the name.

12:21 PM | We3 Vision: how much day it will take ?

12:22 PM | Richie from Hostinger: Good question, you need to verify the domain first from your registered email, then domain will be activated after 24 hours.
