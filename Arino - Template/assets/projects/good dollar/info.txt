Project Description: GoodDollar - Building a Fairer Future Through Design
Client: Etoro, a leading social investment platform.


Role: Art Director / Designer

Project Overview:
Revolutionizing UBI with Blockchain: I had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with GoodDollar, a groundbreaking initiative powered by Etoro, to design the branding and website for their social experiment using blockchain technology to combat wealth inequality.

Humanity at the Core: My focus was creating a visual identity that embodied GoodDollar's decentralization, inclusivity, and empowerment mission. The aim was to move beyond technical jargon and connect with people on a human level, highlighting the transformative potential of UBI.

Branding for Impact: I developed a unique visual language that blended organic shapes with elements of technology, symbolizing the harmonious integration of human values and technological advancement. The color palette emphasized optimism and growth, with vibrant gradients mirroring the diverse global community GoodDollar seeks to impact.

Empowering User Experience: The website design prioritized clarity and accessibility. I implemented intuitive navigation and user-friendly interfaces to ensure anyone, regardless of technical background, could understand and participate in the GoodDollar experiment.

More Than Visuals: Beyond the aesthetics, I actively shaped the narrative around GoodDollar. I contributed to crafting concise messaging that resonated with their target audience and effectively communicated the complex concept of UBI through compelling visuals and storytelling.


Key Achievements:
1. Building brand recognition: Successfully established GoodDollar's distinct visual identity, setting it apart within the crypto and UBI landscape.
2. Connecting with a global audience: Designed a website that transcends cultural barriers and resonates with diverse user groups worldwide.
3. Sparking a conversation: Through impactful visuals and messaging, contributed to generating awareness and dialogue around the potential of UBI to create a fairer world.


Testimonial:
"We were blown away by my ability to capture the essence of GoodDollar in their design work. The branding and website look fantastic and perfectly communicate our mission and values. They've played a crucial role in our launch and continue to be a valuable asset to GoodDollar's success."
